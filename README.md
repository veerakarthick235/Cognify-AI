<p align="center">
  <b>A future‑oriented AI system that predicts human intent & cognitive load before explicit actions</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <i>Conceptual • Innovative • Research‑grade • Portfolio‑ready</i>
</p>

## 🚀 Why CognifyAI?
Most AI systems are **reactive** — they respond after a user acts.  
**CognifyAI is proactive** — it predicts *what a user is about to do* by analyzing passive behavioral signals.

This project explores **next‑generation Human‑AI Interaction**, a domain that is still largely unexplored in real‑world products.

✔ Not copied from GitHub  
✔ Not a CRUD project  
✔ Designed to stand out in interviews

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔮 Intent Probability Prediction
- Predicts multiple possible intents (Proceed, Hesitate, Explore, Overload, Abandon)
- Outputs a **probability distribution**, not a hard decision
- Visualized using a **bar chart**

### 🧠 Cognitive Load Estimation (0–100)
- Estimates mental load in real time
- Categorizes load as **Low / Medium / High**
- Displayed as a **gauge‑style chart**

### 📈 Intent History Timeline
- Tracks how user intent evolves over time
- Demonstrates behavioral trend analysis

### ▶ One‑Click Demo Mode
- Automatically runs analysis every **5 seconds**
- Ideal for demos, viva, and recruiter walkthroughs

### 📊 Visual Dashboard
- Lightweight, fast, and browser‑based
- Built using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Interactive charts powered by **Chart.js**

### 📄 Research‑Ready PDF Report
- Abstract, architecture, algorithm, and results
- Located in the `docs/` directory
